      <description>I am a Systems Administrator working in a Devops role.
This means that, in addition to traditional sysadmin and networking skills, my skillset checks off some popular buzzwords like:
 Infrastructure as Code Configuration Management Continous Integration Loadbalancing Cloud/On-prem Hybrid Infrastructure  In order to maintain some modicum of programming proficiency, I also work on purely web development focussed side projects.
This website is my place to return some of the knowledge I have gained back to the communities who helped me learn, as well as show off some of the cool things that I have independently done.</description>
