      <description>Logbook Structure I&amp;rsquo;m going to start writing a logbook. In it will be a description of what I learned in the course of working on a side project that weekend. The idea comes to me as an easy way to recount what I did, share the lessons learned, and enforce more discipline in consistently working on my side projects.

 Summary  Task Item  Lessons learned  Task Item  Lessons learned    My goal for this blog is not to be useful only to me, but also for my notes to be useful to others who may be trying to learn the same things as myself.</description>
