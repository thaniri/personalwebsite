I am a software professional. I design, implement, deploy, and maintain software systems.

I also like to play competitive video games in my spare time. You may find me doing technical analysis on Starcraft 2.

This website is ad-free and cookie free, and I would like to keep it that way. My content will always be free to distribute and never be behind a paywall.

If this website helps just one person gain some insight, then I consider the whole endeavour a success.
