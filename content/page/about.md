I've made my job finding the balance between software operations and product engineering.

It's my belief that in order to fully engineer a software system, one must be familiar with the entire stack. From the servers running the software to the final software product. Software development and operations are the inseperable halves of a well functioning system.

This website is my place to return some of the knowledge I have gained back to the communities who helped me learn, as well as show off some of the cool things that I have independently done.
